Merge conflicts, DODO not fear them!!!!

This is content that wasn't defintely added through the GitHub interface. I am purposely causing a merge conflict.

This is a forked repo that is used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention.
